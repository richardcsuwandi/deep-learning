# Deep Learning Projects
A series of Deep Learning projects implemented using Keras and TensorFlow.
- [Image Classification on Fashion MNIST Dataset](https://github.com/richardcsuwandi/dl-projects/blob/master/Image%20Classification%20on%20Fashion%20MNIST%20Dataset.ipynb): Create a neural network model to classify clothing images by predicting their labels.
- [Convolutional Neural Network on CIFAR10 Dataset](https://github.com/richardcsuwandi/dl-projects/blob/master/Convolutional%20Neural%20Network%20on%20CIFAR10%20Dataset.ipynb): Create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify CIFAR images.
- [Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Movie Reviews](https://github.com/richardcsuwandi/dl-projects/blob/master/Sentiment%20Analysis%20on%20IMDB%20Movie%20Reviews.ipynb): 
Apply transfer learning to classifiy movie reviews as positive or negative based on the text of the review.
